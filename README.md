# rust_heap_sort
CECS343<br>
I am working on this project solely by myself however I want to practice using github<br>
I primarily change files in 3 places:
1) README.md		# this file
2) Cargo.toml		# dependencies
3) src/				# all source code
The goal of this project was to get a good grade in class. I used github strictly for practice, and understand I likely did things poorly and not in a rust-fashion.
